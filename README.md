Game Idea 

Game Story  
 - The game takes place in a futuristic world, wherein, the find themselves as prisoners in a space dome prison, occasionally the prison guards offer the prisoners an opportunity to earn their freedom, by allowing the prisoners to partake in a series of challenges. 
 - The challenges take the form of three levels, where, at each level the prisoners battle each other. 

- The initial level consists of all four prisoners, upon the completion of each level, the weakest prisoner(s) forfeits their opportunity, with the remaining prisoners proceeding to the next level, where eventually, the winner will be granted their freedom. 

 

Space Dome Rules 

- The players are equipped with ‘launch boots’, that can propel them in any, permitted, direction on the map. it's only during this movement that they can shoot at other players, however, depending on their direction of travel, this may impact their velocity. 

- The Space Dome consists of two basic resources, human growth serum canisters and energy cells. 

- Interaction with the human growth serum results in physical growth, which aids the player’s chances of advancing to the next level, however, the increase in size, consequently, increases the player’s visibility and decreases their movement abilities. Players can drop their canisters at any given time and are therefore able to strategically control their size. 

- Energy and growth serum canister volumes change with each level. 

- The Space Dome contains a scoreboard, which is visible to all players, and contains information on each player’s canister consumption. 

- The Space Dome contains pods on each corner of the arena, where the players start each level in, as well as respawn into. 

- The Space Dome resets every three minutes, with each interval constituting a level. 

- During the final minute of each level, there is an increase in the rate at which energy is generated, as well as the activation of automated cannons. The dome cameras may randomly drop collectibles, ammo and hints on the location of other players. 


Interaction Between Players 

- Players are equipped with several tools, which can be used to convert energy into various types of weapons. 

- Players can either plant energy bombs on, and above, the surface or throw them. 

- Players can temporarily cast a net to capture and pin their competitors to the ground for a short period of time. 

- Collisions with other players result in changes to the initial trajectories of either player. 

- Players can lure other players by dropping their canisters. 

- Players lose a fixed amount of collectible with each damage hit they incur. 

- Players who have been eliminated are able to view the remainder of the challenge through the dome cameras 


Energy uses 

- Energy cells can be used to either, shoot other players or increase the player’s movement abilities, by temporarily surging the launch boots. 

- Energy contains a magnetic property, which can be used to draw canisters towards you; however, this also draws any nearby enemy bullets. 

- Alternatively, the magnetic property of energy can be used to draw away enemy fire. 

- If performed successfully, the player is presented with an opportunity to counterattack their enemy.
